## Mine Sweeper Map

A map of 4 by 3 squares is represented by a two dimensional array of 3 rows by 4 columns. The values are all of type string.
The character `*` represents a mine.
The character `.` represents a space.

Example:

```
*...
..*.
....
```

Your task is to write a program to accept the input and produce a 'hint' field version of the map with the same dimensions, were a square either contains a mine, `*`, or the number of adjacent mines, `2`.

Example:

```
*211
12*1
0111
```
